Welcome to my Project! Here I have a data exploration project using data on shopping trends from Kaggle.  Let me know what you think!

Questions I wanted to answer:
- Does shopping differ between genders?
- Does age play a factor in method of payment preferred? 
- Does delivery method increase purchasing? 

Through the creation of pivot tables and charts to construct a dashboard I uncovered shopping trends between genders and generations. This dataset was used from Kaggle.com and the link is provided here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/customer-shopping-trends-dataset
