Welcome to my Project! Here I have a data exploration project using data on shopping trends from Kaggle.  Let me know what you think!

Questions I wanted to answer:
- Does shopping differ between genders?
- Does age play a factor in method of payment preferred? 
- Does delivery method increase purchasing? 

Through the creation of pivot tables and charts to construct a dashboard I uncovered shopping trends between genders and generations. This dataset was used from Kaggle.com and the link is provided here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/customer-shopping-trends-dataset

## Insights 


#### Men vs Women
It is typical to believe that women spend more while shopping than men but I wanted to find out if data supported this idea. By the creation of a pivot table to sythesize male and female average shopping totals one could see that women did in fact spend more than men on average. To uncover other angles of this I added the subscription column to my pivot then generated the following bar chart.

Whether a women had a subscription or not, on average women spent more than men. The data supports this as women spent $60.25 on average without a subscription and men spent $59.57 without a subscription and $59.49 with one. This analysis concluded that women on average still spent more than men regardless of subscription status or not. 

#### Card or Cash?

Above is my analysis of finding out if different age brackets preferred a method of payment over others. Here I wanted to create a logical test within excel to break down the ages of each shopper into categories. Using the below IF statement I created the following categories, adult (18-31), middle age (31-55) and senior (55+) then named this new column Age Brackets.

This analysis showed me that not only does each age bracket prefer their own payment method for example adults rank higher using PayPal and seniors rank higher using a Debit Card but also shows some overlap in the types of payment methods. For example on average all ages use their Debit Card to conduct purchases and the adults are more inclined to use the new payment methods such as PayPal and Venmo versus middle age and seniors seem to stick with what is easier, Debit or Credit cards. 

#### Amazone Prime Same Day Delivery?

![Shipping](https://github.com/Alex-57Soto/Excel-Shopping-Dashboard/blob/main/3rd.JPG)

Above is a bar chart that displays the preference of shipping method and average purchases made by men and women. This analysis was actually fun to do since I did not have any assumptions going into this as it could tilt either way. Say if one was to look at the 2-Day shipping they would conclude that men will purchase more than women but if it was a store pickup then women purchased more. I enjoyed how the different methods showed men prefer a certain shipping method over others and so do women. What is even more interesting is how close the two genders are when express shipping was an option. Women on average spent $60.51 while men spent $60.46. These numbers are very close and I wonder what further analyses can be done to understand why.

Lastly above is my interactive dashboard which allows users to see how these charts will change when certain filters are applied such as age brackets, location and season. Feel free to download my excel file to try it yourself!
