Welcome to my Project! Here I have a data exploration project using data on shopping trends from Kaggle.  Let me know what you think!

Questions I wanted to answer:
- Does shopping differ between genders?
- Does age play a factor in method of payment preferred? 
- Does delivery method increase purchasing? 

Through the creation of pivot tables and charts to construct a dashboard I uncovered shopping trends between genders and generations. This dataset was used from Kaggle.com and the link is provided here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/customer-shopping-trends-dataset

## Insights 


#### Men vs Women
It is typical to believe that women spend more while shopping than men but I wanted to find out if data supported this idea. By the creation of a pivot table to sythesize male and female average shopping totals one could see that women did in fact spend more than men on average. To uncover other angles of this I added the subscription column to my pivot then generated the following bar chart.

Whether a women had a subscription or not, on average women spent more than men. The data supports this as women spent $60.25 on average without a subscription and men spent $59.57 without a subscription and $59.49 with one. This analysis concluded that women on average still spent more than men regardless of subscription status or not. 

#### Card or Cash?

Above is my analysis of finding out if different age brackets preferred a method of payment over others. Here I wanted to create a logical test within excel to break down the ages of each shopper into categories. Using the below IF statement I created the following categories, adult (18-31), middle age (31-55) and senior (55+) then named this new column Age Brackets.

Lastly above is my interactive dashboard which allows users to see how these charts will change when certain filters are applied such as age brackets, location and season. Feel free to download my excel file to try it yourself!
