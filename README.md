Welcome to my Project! Here I have a data exploration project using data on shopping trends from Kaggle.  Let me know what you think!

Questions I wanted to answer:
- Does shopping differ between genders?
- Does age play a factor in method of payment preferred? 
- Does delivery method increase purchasing? 

Through the creation of pivot tables and charts to construct a dashboard I uncovered shopping trends between genders and generations. This dataset was used from Kaggle.com and the link is provided here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/customer-shopping-trends-dataset

## Insights 


#### Men vs Women
It is typical to believe that women spend more while shopping than men but I wanted to find out if data supported this idea. By the creation of a pivot table to sythesize male and female average shopping totals one could see that women did in fact spend more than men on average. To uncover other angles of this I added the subscription column to my pivot then generated the following bar chart.

Whether a women had a subscription or not, on average women spent more than men. The data supports this as women spent $60.25 on average without a subscription and men spent $59.57 without a subscription and $59.49 with one. This analysis concluded that women on average still spent more than men regardless of subscription status or not.
